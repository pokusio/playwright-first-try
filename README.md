## Purpose

This repo is about trying to use the playwright test tool,; as a very interesting alternative to `Cypress`.


## First try


Playwright is a product which consists of two main parts :
* The test runner : that's for running tests. See https://playwright.dev/docs/intro
* The test library: that's for writing new softwares which execute tests. See https://playwright.dev/docs/library

### Using the Playwright test runner

_Following: https://playwright.dev/docs/intro_

See [the `parts/using/the_test_runner` folder](./parts/using/the_test_runner) Folder for the study of the test runner.

### Using the Playwright Library

_Following: https://playwright.dev/docs/intro_

See [the `parts/using/the_library` folder](./parts/using/the_library) Folder for the study of the test runner.
